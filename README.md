I made this project to learn more about .net MVC. I had a spotify account that got accidentally deleted which made me lose a bunch of my songs that I enjoyed but I could not remember all of my lists.
So to fix that problem in the future I made this CRUD .net app where I could store my songs with the name, author, genre etc. This app uses asp.NET Core MVC with mysql.
